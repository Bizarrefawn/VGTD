Born in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (Q.E.H) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. started early child schooling at Precious Lambs Daycare then proceeded on to the first three years of grade school at Greenfield Elementry. after that I moved on to the next 3 years at Elmstreet Elementry. within the following 3 years I moved up to Summerside Intermediate School, and for my last three years they were spent geetting a high school diploma from Three Oaks Senior High School. My life has gonna in many ways it had its ups and downs and it has landed me here at Eastern College, pursuing my dream job, Quality Advisor or QA as some would call it. Growing up i had always had an easy supply of work with being neighbors to an elderly farm couple. I would plant and pick vegetables and load/unload logs into their basement. As I grew up it was time to start earning more so i got a real job at an amusment park, Burlington Amusment Park. After that i got a job at Prince Edward Aqua 	Farms. With the money I saved i moved away to Moncton, New Brunswick with my girlfriend we rented an apartment. That about sums up my life in a nutshell and hopefully you learnd a little something about me.<td>

	<td>Interest change as one ages. Some keep something close to them and others forget their past all together. For me a specific interest Stayed with me all along it's what made me want to play video games so much. Pokemon what started out as a small pocket monster game has grown into a huge franchise made by Game Freak. Now it has grown with a tv series, a video game and other miscellaneous merchandise. I for one am fond of the games and the development of the creatures known as pokemon. Two pokemon have caught my eye throughout the years and I grew fond of them they make a great duo in double battles. As for other interest they have grown as other things were released even the more recent ones. but all that boils down to andall these things have a similarity and that is they are all video games for the most part.</td>
